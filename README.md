# Coursera- Intermediate Pandas

This repo contains a subset from the open dataset by Shantayanan Devarajan et al., World Bank. What Does Aid to Africa Finance? (WDAAF) 1970-1996. Ref. AFR_1996_WDAAF_v01_M. Dataset downloaded from https://microdata.worldbank.org/index.php/catalog/431/study-description on 07-14-2020. The data has been used to demonstrate data wrangling and pre-processing using Pandas.


### About:

The database includes data from Botswana, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Ethiopia, The Gambia, Ghana, Kenya, Lesotho, Liberia, Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritius, Nigeria, Sudan, Swaziland, Zaire, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.

If a donor gives aid for a project that the recipient government would have undertaken anyway, then the aid is financing some expenditure other than the intended project. The notion that aid in this sense may be "fungible," while long recognized, has recently been receiving some empirical support.
